# Calcimpy Basics

## Goal

Writing a program which calculate input-end acoustic impedance of given air column ( wind instrument's bore  ) 
by Python.

Air column's shape ( so called MENSUR ) should be given by XMEN format.

## XMEN FORMAT

XMEN format is defined here to notify air column's shape (MENSUR).

It is a CSV text file with '.xmen' as its extension.

Any spaces and tabs are ignored.

Comment is inserted at any position starting with  '#' (same as Python).

### Basics

Most simple air column is a tapered tube with starting diameter df, ending diameter db and length r.

Df denotes Diameter Forward, db: Diameter Backward, R: relative length.

It can be expressed by simple line.

```
df,db,r
```
It is a straight tube if df == db.

To express whether end is open or closed, ending line is needed.

For open end,

```
df,db,r
db,0,0,
```

and for closed end,

```
df,db,r,
0,0,0,
```

You can use pre-defined keywords `OPEN_END`, `CLOSED_END` to instead of writing `db,0,0,` or `0,0,0` directly.

For more complex format, main trunc must be bracketed by `[]`.

```
[
    df,db,r
    db,0,0,
]
```

Or use keyword,

```
MAIN
df,db,r,
db,0,0,
END_MAIN
```

So, a simple tube mensur file can be written as,

```
# simple tube 
[
    10,10,1000,
    10,10,0,# open end
]
```

### Tube with varying diameter 

For a tube with varyin diameter like brass instrument's bell, if it is sliced into thin part along with its axis, each thin part can be approximated by a tapered tube.
Black lines of next picture is such a example.

![bell.png](bell.png)

Each thin tapered tube has its own $df_i,db_i,r_i$ and a whole tube can be expressed by sequencial thin tubes.

```
df1,db1,r1
df2,db2,r2
df3,db3,r3
...
```
Most of the case, $df_i = db_{i-1}$.

### Grouping

It is easy to write and read a mensur file, if we can use grouping.

`GROUP, END_GROUP` or symbol '{}' can be used to express grouping.

```
{,BELL
16.0,16.009980886991173,1.0
16.009980886991173,16.019980475710756,1.0
...
219.00691080366659,250.1561248607896,1.0
250.1561248607896,300.0,1.0
}
```

This group can be inserted using `INSERT` or `@` in XMEN.

```
INSERT, name
```


### SPLIT PATH (TONEHOLE)

Sometimes there is a splitting side hole path to outside like a tonehole of woodwind instruments or a waterkey of brass instruments.

It is better to include their effect into calculation even when they are closed by key cover, because short perpendicular path is connected to main path.

![tonehole.png](tonehole.png)

Provided z1,z2 as each trunc's acoustic impedance, z at connecting point is,

$$
\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{z_1} + \frac{1}{z_2}
$$

To express this SPLIT, keyword `SPLIT` and symbol `|` can be used in XMEN file.

```
SPLIT, name, ratio
```

Here, `name` is a group name of splitting path, `ratio` is value between [0,1].
0: actually does not connect splitting path.
1: whole effect of splitting path is included.

```
# sample split mensur
[
    10,10,150,
    |,TH1,1,
    10,10,850,
    OPEN_END
]

{,TH1
8,8,5,
OPEN_END
}
```

### BRANCH and MERGE 

In a brass instrument's valve, 2 paths are blended while it is changing.
Such state must be calculated to know half valve acoustic impedance.

![loop.png](loop.png)

For precise calculation at merging point (left side of picture above), see 
[loop_impedance.nb.pdf](loop_impedance.nb.pdf).

For this purpose, `BRANCH` and `MERGE` or `<` and `>` can be used in XMEN file.

```
BRANCH, name, ratio
... # main path
... # main path
MERGE, name, ratio
```
`name` is a group name of another path and `ratio` is connecting ratio [0,1].
0: does not connect to another path (main path only). 1: another path only. skip main path between BRANCH and MERGE. 
If `ratio` is between 0 and 1, two paths are blended. 

```
# branch test mensur
[
10,10,300,
<,SL1,0.5
10,10,200,
>,SL1,0.5,
10,10,500,
OPEN_END
]

{,SL1
12,12,100,
OPEN_END
}
``` 

## IMPEDANCE CALCULATION

### Webster equation

In an acoustic air column, webster equation is used to explain its sound field.

$$
\frac{d^2 q(x)}{dx^2} + \frac{1}{S(x)} \frac{dS(x)}{dx} \frac{d q(x)}{dx} + k^2 q(x) = 0  
$$

where q(x) is a velocity potential function, S(x) is a section area at x, and k : wave number.

For simple taper (df,db,r) $x \in [0,r]$,

$$
S(x) = \frac{\pi}{4} ( \frac{db (r-x) + df x}{r} ) ^2 
$$

Substituting this into the equation, it has general solution,

$$
q(x) = \frac{A exp(i k x) + B exp(-i k x)}{db (r-x) + df x} 
$$

Let pi,Ui pressure and volume velocity at input end (x=0), and po, Uo at output end (x=r).

Since $p = i \omega \rho q(x)$ and $U = -\frac{dq(x)}{dx} S(x)$, we can write transmission equation as, 

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
 pi \\
 Ui
 \end{pmatrix}
= T
\begin{pmatrix}
po \\
Uo
\end{pmatrix}
$$

where T is a transmission matrix in this part.

And using z $\equiv$ p/U zi is calculated from zo.

See [Webster_equation.nb.pdf](Webster_equation.nb.pdf) for more precise expression.

### Wall dumping effect

To include wall dumping effect into acount,
wave number k is modified to have imaginary part.

$$
k = \sqrt{\frac{\omega}{c}(\frac{\omega}{c} - 2 (-1+i) A)}
$$

$$
A = (1 + \frac{\gamma-1}{\sqrt{Pr}})\frac{\sqrt{2 \omega \nu}}{c D}
$$

$\gamma$ : specific heat constant, Pr : Prandtl number, $\nu$ : dynamic viscous constant, $\omega$ : wave frequency, D : average diameter, c : speed of sound.
